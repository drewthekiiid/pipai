## CRITICAL ISSUE SUMMARY
The Vercel deployment is blocked by React context errors during build-time static generation.
Despite adding dynamic exports and disabling static optimization, Next.js is still trying to prerender pages.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED
1. Try deploying with server-side only configuration
2. Check for React version mismatches in the monorepo 
3. Consider using Next.js 15 or different build approach
4. May need to temporarily remove problematic components

## BUILD STATUS: FAILING
Root cause: React useContext returns null during static generation
Error location: .next/server/chunks/260.js (compiled React context handling)
