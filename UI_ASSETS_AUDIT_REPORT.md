# UI Assets Audit Report

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Duplicate Design Token Files**
- `packages/ui/src/design-tokens.ts` (CDO-branded, current)
- `packages/ui/src/design-tokens-new.ts` (Generic blue theme)
- `packages/ui/src/design-tokens.css` (CSS version)

**Conflict**: Two different design token systems with conflicting color schemes:
- Main file uses CDO Red (#EF2323) as primary
- New file uses blue (#0ea5e9) as primary

### 2. **Component Export Issues**
In `packages/ui/src/index.ts`:
- `CDOUploadDock` is incorrectly aliased to `UploadDock` instead of the actual CDO component
- Missing export for `FuturisticChatInterface` component
- Missing proper component exports

### 3. **Component Naming Conflicts**
- `upload-dock.tsx` (generic)
- `cdo-upload-dock.tsx` (CDO-branded)
- Both export similar functionality but with different branding

### 4. **Inconsistent Design Token Usage**
- Some components may be using the wrong design token file
- `design-tokens-new.ts` has different component specifications than main file

## Recommended Actions

### 1. **Consolidate Design Tokens**
- Keep `design-tokens.ts` (CDO-branded) as the primary file
- Remove `design-tokens-new.ts` (outdated)
- Keep `design-tokens.css` for CSS-only usage if needed

### 2. **Fix Component Exports**
- Export `FuturisticChatInterface` component
- Fix `CDOUploadDock` export to point to correct component
- Ensure all components are properly exported

### 3. **Standardize Component Naming**
- Keep CDO-branded components as primary
- Consider deprecating generic versions or clearly separate them

### 4. **Verify Component Dependencies**
- Ensure all components use the correct design tokens
- Check for any hardcoded values that should use tokens
