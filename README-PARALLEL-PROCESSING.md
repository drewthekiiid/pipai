# 🚀 Parallel Processing with Unstructured.io

## Overview

PIP AI now supports **parallel processing** for PDF documents using Unstructured.io's built-in concurrent processing capabilities. This can provide **5-15x speed improvements** for large construction documents.

## Features

### 🔄 Automatic PDF Splitting

- PDFs are split into batches of 2-20 pages
- Processed concurrently for maximum speed
- Automatic batch size optimization

### ⚡ Configurable Concurrency

- **Standard**: 10 concurrent requests (default)
- **Large PDF**: 15 concurrent requests (maximum)
- Automatic detection based on file size (20MB threshold)

### 🛡️ Fault Tolerance

- Processing continues even if some pages fail
- Partial results are preserved
- Detailed error reporting for failed batches

### 🎯 Smart Optimization

- Fast strategy for speed
- Images disabled by default (can be enabled)
- Tables extraction optimized for construction analysis
- Coordinates and page breaks disabled for performance

## Usage

### Automatic (Recommended)

The system automatically detects file size and uses appropriate optimization:

```javascript
// This will automatically use parallel processing
const result = await extractTextActivity("/path/to/document.pdf");
```

### Manual Configuration

For fine-grained control:

```javascript
import { createUnstructuredClient } from "./packages/worker/dist/unstructured-client.js";

const client = createUnstructuredClient();

// Standard parallel processing
const result = await client.processDocument(filePath, {
  strategy: "fast",
  extractImages: false,
  extractTables: true,
  enableParallelProcessing: true,
  concurrencyLevel: 10,
  allowPartialFailure: true,
});

// Maximum optimization for large PDFs
const largeResult = await client.processLargePDF(filePath, {
  maxConcurrency: 15,
  allowPartialFailure: true,
  extractTables: true,
});
```

## Performance Benchmarks

| File Size | Processing Method | Expected Time | Improvement   |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 5MB PDF   | Sequential        | 30-60s        | Baseline      |
| 5MB PDF   | Parallel (10x)    | 5-10s         | 5-6x faster   |
| 40MB PDF  | Sequential        | 5-10 min      | Baseline      |
| 40MB PDF  | Parallel (15x)    | 30-60s        | 10-15x faster |

## Configuration Options

### Standard Processing

```javascript
{
  strategy: 'fast',              // 5-10x faster than 'hi_res'
  extractImages: false,          // Disabled for speed
  extractTables: true,           // Enabled for construction analysis
  coordinates: false,            // Disabled for speed
  includePage: false,            // Disabled for speed
  enableParallelProcessing: true, // Enable parallel processing
  concurrencyLevel: 10,          // 10 concurrent requests
  allowPartialFailure: true      // Continue if some pages fail
}
```

### Large PDF Optimization

```javascript
{
  maxConcurrency: 15,        // Maximum allowed by Unstructured.io
  allowPartialFailure: true, // Fault tolerance
  extractTables: true        // Keep for construction analysis
}
```

## Monitoring and Logs

The system provides detailed logging:

```
[Unstructured] Processing document: large-project.pdf
[Unstructured] Parallel processing: enabled (15 concurrent)
[Unstructured] File size: 42.5MB
[Unstructured] Using large PDF optimization
[Unstructured] PDF will be split into batches and processed with 15 concurrent requests
[Unstructured] Processed 1,847 elements in 45,230ms
[Unstructured] Parallel processing completed successfully
```

## Testing

### Quick Test

```bash
# Start the Unstructured service
npm run start-unstructured-free

# Test parallel processing
node test-parallel-processing.mjs
```

### Expected Output

📊 Performance Summary:
   • Parallel processing: ENABLED ✅
   • Speed optimization: ACTIVE ✅
   • Large PDF support: READY ✅
   • Construction analysis: OPTIMIZED ✅
```

## Troubleshooting

### Service Not Available

```bash
# Check if service is running
curl -m 5 http://localhost:8000/healthcheck

# Start the service
npm run start-unstructured-free

# Or with Docker
docker run -p 8000:8000 unstructured/unstructured-api:latest
```

### Timeout Issues

- Increase timeout for very large files
- Reduce concurrency level if resource constrained
- Enable `allowPartialFailure` for fault tolerance

### Memory Issues

- Reduce `concurrencyLevel` (try 5 instead of 10)
- Use `strategy: 'fast'` instead of `'hi_res'`
- Disable image extraction: `extractImages: false`

## Integration

The parallel processing is automatically integrated into:

- ✅ **Worker Activities**: `extractTextActivity()` uses parallel processing by default
- ✅ **Temporal Workflows**: Enhanced timeouts for parallel processing jobs
- ✅ **Web API**: Upload and processing endpoints benefit automatically
- ✅ **Streaming**: Real-time updates during parallel processing

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Dynamic concurrency based on system resources
- [ ] Progress reporting for individual batches
- [ ] Selective page processing based on content detection
- [ ] Caching of processed batches for re-processing
