# 🤖 OpenAI Assistant Setup & Testing

## Quick Start

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   cd pipai
   pnpm dev
   # OR from apps/web:
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the Assistant API:**

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/assistant
   ```

3. **Open the chat interface:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/demo/simple-streaming
   ```

## 🏗️ How It Works

### Backend (AssistanAPI)

- **Endpoint**: `/api/assistant`
- **Method**: POST with FormData
- **Files**: Sent directly (no base64 conversion)
- **Response**: Full construction analysis

### Frontend (Chat Component)

- Upload PDFs, images, or specifications
- Files processed by GPT-4o with specialized construction knowledge
- Real-time progress indicators
- Professional CSI-formatted output

## 🎯 Benefits Over Previous System

| Feature        | Old System              | New Assistant System           |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| PDF Processing | Convert to images first | Native PDF handling            |
| File Limits    | 4.5MB (base64 bloat)    | Much higher limits             |
| Context        | Single request          | Persistent threads             |
| Tools          | Basic vision            | File search + code interpreter |
| Architecture   | Complex pipeline        | Simple & clean                 |

## 🧪 Test Cases

### Test 1: Basic Functionality

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/assistant
```

Should return assistant status and capabilities.

### Test 2: PDF Upload

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/demo/simple-streaming
2. Upload a construction PDF
3. Send message: "Analyze this document"
4. Assistant creates professional scope of work

### Test 3: Multi-file Analysis

1. Upload multiple construction documents
2. Send: "Compare these plans and list all trades"
3. Get comprehensive trade analysis across all files

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in `.env.local`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=asst_p4zYGecM2u6Fd676lma1OGfV
```

The system will use your specific EstimAItor assistant (asst_p4zYGecM2u6Fd676lma1OGfV) which has already been trained and configured for construction document analysis.

## 🚀 Deploy Ready

The assistant system is:

- ✅ Vercel compatible
- ✅ Production ready
- ✅ No complex dependencies
- ✅ Simplified architecture

The old PDF-to-image processing can be safely removed!
